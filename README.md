### Typed Semantic Documents for LLMs

> **SkillForge** is a Rust toolchain that gives LLMs **typed semantic structure** — claims, evidence, definitions, steps, verification blocks — in formats they demonstrably follow better than raw Markdown. Import HTML, PDF, or Markdown. Author verifiable skills for Claude, Codex, and Gemini. Migrate codebases with typed migration skills.

## The Problem

LLMs treat all text as flat content. When you send raw Markdown or HTML, the model has no way to distinguish a **claim** from **evidence**, a **step** from a **verification check**, or a **precondition** from an **output contract**. This matters:

- **Agents skip steps** because nothing marks instruction blocks as typed steps
- **RAG pipelines lose structure** because chunking splits documents at arbitrary token boundaries
- **Skills degrade** because the model can't tell which blocks are constraints vs. examples

## The Evidence

We benchmarked 5 skills × 21 scenarios × 6 formats (126 runs, claude-sonnet-4-6):

| Format | Tokens | Overall | Constraints | Multi-Step |
|--------|--------|---------|-------------|------------|
| **LML Aggressive** | **861** | **0.88** | **0.89** | **0.81** |
| JSON IR | 3,838 | 0.87 | 0.87 | 0.74 |
| LML Standard | 928 | 0.86 | 0.88 | 0.74 |
| Raw Markdown | 901 | 0.84 | 0.86 | 0.72 |
| HTML | 1,217 | 0.84 | 0.87 | 0.73 |
| AIF Source | 1,024 | 0.82 | 0.85 | 0.72 |

**LML Aggressive wins overall (+4pp vs Markdown)** at 4% fewer tokens. The advantage is strongest on **multi-step workflows** (+9pp) and **constraint respect** (+3pp). On standard scenarios, all formats score ~0.95 — the gap only appears when the task requires judgment. See [full benchmark](benchmarks/skill-execution/).

## Two Core Capabilities

### 1. Document Cleaning & Semantic Enrichment

**For data pipeline engineers** — normalize messy HTML, PDF, and Markdown into a typed semantic IR that LLMs can reason about, not just read.

```bash
# Import and enrich documents
aif import page.html --strip-chrome           # Strip nav/footer chrome, keep content
aif import paper.pdf                          # PDF → structured blocks with confidence scores
aif import doc.md --infer-semantics           # Auto-detect claims, evidence, definitions
aif import doc.md --infer-llm                 # LLM-assisted semantic classification

# Compile for LLM consumption
aif compile doc.aif --format lml-aggressive   # Typed tags, minimal tokens
aif compile doc.aif --format lml-aggressive --view llm  # Strip examples, truncate code

# Validate structure
aif lint doc.aif                              # 10 structural checks including broken refs
```

**What you get vs. plain text extraction:**

| What you send the LLM | Structure | Roundtrip | Use case |
|------------------------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| Cleaned HTML text | None — flat string | No | Cheap Q&A, summarization |
| Raw Markdown | Basic (headings, lists) | Partial | General documents |
| **AIF LML Aggressive** | **Typed blocks: claims, evidence, tables, definitions** | **Yes** | **Structured reasoning, agents, RAG** |

### 2. Skill Authoring & Verification

**For AI tool builders** — write skills with typed instruction blocks that LLMs follow more reliably, with built-in versioning, eval, and deployment.

```aif
@skill[name="code-review", version="1.0"]
  @precondition
    PR has passing CI and at least one approval.
  @end

  @step[order=1]
    Understand the PR context before reviewing code.
  @end

  @verify
    Every blocking issue includes a concrete fix suggestion.
  @end

  @red_flag
    Don't bikeshed on style while missing logic bugs.
  @end

  @output_contract
    Return structured review: summary, blocking issues, suggestions.
  @end
@end
```

Full lifecycle: `import` (MD→AIF) → `verify` (integrity hash) → `eval` (3-stage quality pipeline) → `diff` (semantic diff) → `bump` (auto-version) → `resolve` (inheritance chains) → deploy to Claude Code / Codex / Gemini.

See [skills guide](examples/skills/) for authoring, validation, and deployment.

## Install

```bash
# From source
cargo install --path crates/aif-cli

# Then use anywhere
aif compile doc.aif --format html
aif import doc.md --infer-semantics
aif lint doc.aif
```

## AIF Syntax

```aif
#title: Research Summary
#author: Team

@section[id=findings]: Key Findings
  @claim[id=c1, refs=e1]
    Typed semantic blocks improve LLM instruction-following by 10pp.
  @end

  @evidence[id=e1]
    Benchmark: 0.84 compliance (LML) vs 0.80 (raw Markdown), +18pp on constraint resistance.
  @end

  @definition[id=d1]
    **Compliance** means step coverage + constraint respect + output contract adherence.
  @end

  @table[id=results, refs=c1]: Format Comparison
  | Format | Compliance | Tokens |
  | LML Aggressive | 0.97 | 1,012 |
  | Raw Markdown | 0.87 | 1,067 |
@end
```

Typed blocks (`@claim`, `@evidence`, `@definition`, `@table`, `@figure`) are preserved across all 12 output formats. `aif lint` validates cross-references, evidence chains, undefined terms, and structural integrity.

---

## Migration Engine

Typed migration skills with automated verification and repair:

```bash
aif migrate run --skill nextjs-13-to-15.aif --source ./src --output ./migrated
```

Pipeline: validate skill → chunk source files → apply per-chunk (LLM) → verify (static regex + semantic) → repair loop → generate AIF report. Three production examples included. See [migration examples](examples/).

---

## Artifact Skills

Generate structured business artifacts — spreadsheets, diagrams, reports — from typed inputs:

```bash
# Generate Excel workbook from benchmark results
pip install openpyxl
python artifacts/benchmark-workbook/generate.py

# Generate Mermaid flowchart from any AIF skill
python artifacts/skill-diagram/generate.py examples/skills/code_review.aif

# Generate SVG (requires mermaid-cli)
python artifacts/skill-diagram/generate.py examples/skills/code_review.aif --format svg
```

Define artifact skills in AIF with `@artifact_skill`, `@input_schema`, `@template`, `@binding`, `@generate`, `@verify`, `@export` blocks. See [artifacts/](artifacts/) for examples and the artifact skill pattern.

                                    │           ├── LLM (5 LML modes)
                          Lint / Infer /        └── Machine (JSON, Binary)
                          View filtering
